      <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an Applied Informatics graduate who had the occasions to work in public institutions in administration and
        IT support.
        Hovewer, I had the desire to dive into web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to choose this field of IT sphere because I have artistic abilities that I develop throughout my
        life, but in addition
        I have always had an aspiration
        towards sciences - mathematics, physics, in which I had very good teachers and passed exams in the
        country of my previous residence, as well as here.
        Web programming contains a plane that allows you to release
        creativity and at the same time it is a part of a science - computer science. <br><br>
        So I signed up for the <i>web development course</i> where I gained knowledge and practical skills of front
        end tools and programming there. <br>
        After that I joined the Rolling Scopes School where I have been having
        the possibility to learn some new things and make projects while participating in community and exchanging
        knowledge with others
        by the way having a chance to look at some things from different perspective. <br>
        Due to the growing demands of the IT market, in addition to my already formed profile, I decided to delve into
        <i>software testing</i> in order to increase my competitiveness. Therefore, I have recently applied for a
        correspondence postgraduate education in the specialty software testing on Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow
        University.
